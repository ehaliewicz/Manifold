This release of the editor needs SDL2.dll in the same directory/folder as the exe.
Plus you will need to provide a textures, sprites, and music directory/folder matching the one in conf.ini.
You need to provide at least one texture and at least one sprite in these folders.

For music, you will also need SGDK's xgmtool.  You can find that on the SGDK github repository.
